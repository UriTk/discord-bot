# discord-bot
Bots I made for discord. Probably all python, mostly all fiverr. Lacking some newer references (2021-Present), mostly due to it being propietary code.
As a brief description of these:

MZ. 

  A Warzone "assign role depending on KD" bot.
  
Web Scrapper. 

  I think this one was just a basic web scrapper for "best-hashtags.com"
  
Discordbot Giveaway.

  "Join X server to apply to this giveaway!", the bot.
  
Gacha-bot.

  Anime themed gacha bot, with a database not made by me, and in on itself a continuation of another coder's work.
  
Invite bot.

  If memory recalls, this one generates user-specific invites and keeps track of how many people have used that specific invite.
  
shiba-anime-bot

  My baby.
  
short-exam-bot

  Self explaintory. Simply gives a quiz in DMs
